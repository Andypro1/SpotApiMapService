getpoints.js
------------
Add this script to cron with

crontab -e

Then enter

*/5	*	*	*	*	/usr/local/bin/node <<your-script-path>>/getpoints.js <<your-spot-feed-id>> <<your-spot-feed-password>>

to update the master list of points every five mintutes, for example.  Alternatively, just run it manually from a shell.


servepoints.js
--------------
Run this simple http service with node however you'd like.  I have mine running on port 4446 behind an nginx proxy.
